# IDATG2102 - Algorithmic methods

This project includes tree functions and more  in C++. Examples: It provides basic operations for creating a BST, 
inserting nodes, and performing tree traversals. All the functions has been created in connection with the course

## Features

- Creation.
- Insertion.
- Traversals.
- Basic node structure.
- And plenty more

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/marhjoh/IDATG2102.git
```

## Usage
This section provides examples of how to use the binary search tree in your own C++ programs.

### Creating a Tree
To create a binary search tree, you can instantiate a TreeFunctions object:

```cpp
TreeFunctions tree;
```

### Inserting Nodes
You can insert nodes into the tree using the insert method:

```cpp
tree.insert(5);
tree.insert(3);
tree.insert(7);
tree.insert(2);
tree.insert(4);
```

### Traversing the Tree
The tree supports in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals. Here's an example of how to perform an in-order traversal:

```cpp
tree.inOrderTraverse();
```
